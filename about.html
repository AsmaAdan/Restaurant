								<h2>Maria's garden spread</h2>
								<p>On countless occasions life equals the courage you put into it. Maria courageously left Neapolitan hills with one dream; to spread the joy's of Neapolitan cuiine in the Kenyan Plains.
									she opens her backyard garden to any traveller and passerby willing to have a Fun and funky time  with eclectic food and wine </p>
								<p>With freshly baked bread served as you sit down, menus that accommodate multiple courses as easily as a quick lunch and an exclusive wine list to fit any taste, Maria's kitchen thrives on the simple thrill of good food and drink.
									Under the watchful eye of Maria, regional kitchen classics from across Italy are faithfully recreated with the occasional signature twist.
									Ingredients like dry pasta, parmesan and prosciutto are imported from Naples and everything else is made from scratch in the kitchens, with each cut of meat and all of the fresh seafood hand-selected from premium vendors.
									Carefully curated wine list is also mostly drawn from Italy, with other select bottles from vineyards spread across the world.</p>
