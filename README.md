##### Learning JavaScript at Moringa School prep requires the setting up of an application using HTML,CSS and JavaScript by a group of collaborators.
##### This particular application, allows users to view, choose and then place an order of the food they want.
##### It allows the user to order the food in the restaurant premises, take a delivery or pre-order the food while en-route.
##### You can take a look at it and let us know any changes we should make or any suggestions you maybe having on how we should make our design and functionality better. Thank you in advance.
## BDD
#### Want to test how I did this project?
##### Here are the specs:

*The application allows the user to know about the restaurant through an About us webpage: it contains info about the restaurant along with a Carousel of staff images

*The application allows the user to view the categories of food, their description and prices.

*The application allows the user to view customer reviews.

*The application allows the user to select the type of food they want.

*The application allows the user to select the type of order they want.

*The application allows the user to add their order to a shopping cart.

*The application allows the user to remove items from their shopping cart.

*The application prompts the user to confirm, then send an email that contains: the type of food and the total price.

*The application sends the user a confirmation email.
